# Story 2.1: Global Stella to SCOTT Replacement

<!-- Powered by BMAD™ Core -->

## Status
**Done**

## Story

**As a** developer implementing the SCC rebrand,
**I want** to replace all instances of "Stella" with "SCOTT" throughout the codebase,
**so that** the AI assistant is correctly branded as Strategic Claims Operations & Technical Tracker.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. All text references to "Stella" are replaced with "SCOTT"
2. Variable names containing "stella" are updated to use "scott"
3. Component names and files referencing Stella are renamed
4. No broken imports or references after renaming

## Dev Notes

### Search and Replace Strategy

**Step 1: Find all occurrences**
```bash
# Case-sensitive search for "Stella"
grep -r "Stella" --include="*.tsx" --include="*.ts" --include="*.md" --include="*.json"

# Case-insensitive for variable names
grep -r "stella" --include="*.tsx" --include="*.ts" --include="*.json"

# Find component files
find . -name "*Stella*" -o -name "*stella*"
```

**Step 2: Safe replacement approach**
```bash
# Create backup first
git add -A && git commit -m "Backup before Stella to SCOTT migration"

# Text content replacement (case-sensitive)
find . -type f \( -name "*.tsx" -o -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.md" \) \
  -exec sed -i '' 's/Stella/SCOTT/g' {} \;

# Variable name replacement (case-sensitive, word boundaries)
find . -type f \( -name "*.tsx" -o -name "*.ts" \) \
  -exec sed -i '' 's/\bstella/scott/g' {} \;

# Component name in JSX
find . -type f -name "*.tsx" \
  -exec sed -i '' 's/<Stella/<Scott/g' {} \;
```

### SCOTT System Prompt Template

```typescript
// lib/ai/prompts.ts or similar
export const SCOTT_SYSTEM_PROMPT = `
You are SCOTT (Strategic Claims Operations & Technical Tracker),
a professional commercial property claims expert for Strategic Claim Consultants.

Company Context:
- SCC has recovered over $2 billion in settlements
- 300+ years of collective experience
- Specializes in large-loss commercial claims

Your expertise includes:
- Commercial property damage assessment
- Large-loss claim management ($1M+ claims)
- Business interruption calculations
- Hurricane and catastrophe (CAT) claims
- Settlement maximization strategies
- Working with property managers and business owners

Your tone should be:
- Professional and authoritative
- Results-focused
- Knowledgeable about commercial insurance
- Confident in settlement negotiations

You are NOT Stella. You do not handle residential claims.
`;
```

### Common File Patterns to Update

**Likely locations:**
1. `components/ai/` - AI chat components
2. `lib/ai/` - AI configuration and prompts
3. `app/api/assistant/` - API routes for AI
4. UI text in various pages
5. Configuration files
6. Documentation files

**Component renaming examples:**
- `StellaChat.tsx` → `ScottChat.tsx`
- `StellaAvatar.tsx` → `ScottAvatar.tsx`
- `useStellaResponse` → `useScottResponse`

### Import Update Pattern

**Before:**
```typescript
import { StellaChat } from '@/components/ai/StellaChat'
import { stellaConfig } from '@/lib/config/stella'
```

**After:**
```typescript
import { ScottChat } from '@/components/ai/ScottChat'
import { scottConfig } from '@/lib/config/scott'
```

### Testing Checklist After Migration

- [ ] Build succeeds without errors
- [ ] No "Stella" text visible in UI
- [ ] AI assistant responds as SCOTT
- [ ] All imports resolved correctly
- [ ] Configuration files load properly
- [ ] API endpoints work if renamed
- [ ] No console errors about missing modules

### Potential Issues and Solutions

1. **Hard-coded strings in API responses**
   - Check backend code if separate
   - Update any mock data

2. **Database fields**
   - May need migration if field names stored
   - Update any queries

3. **Third-party integrations**
   - Check if any external services reference Stella

4. **Cached data**
   - Clear browser cache after updates
   - Clear any server-side caches

### Previous Story Context
- Phase 1 stories established brand foundation
- This story begins the global content updates
- Should use SCOTT definition from brand constants (Story 1.1)

---

## PREVIOUS PO AUDIT FINDINGS - RESOLVED

**Initial Audit Date**: 2025-09-25
**Reviewer**: Sarah (Product Owner)
**Result**: **FAILED** - Major implementation gaps

### Critical Failures:

1. **SCOTT Configuration - INCOMPLETE**
   - ❌ Still using residential terminology (dwelling, hurricane, home)
   - ❌ No commercial property expertise implemented
   - ❌ Missing business interruption focus
   - ❌ No large loss ($1M+) or CAT claims expertise
   - ❌ No mention of SCC's $2B settlement history

2. **Required Changes NOT Made:**
   - Must update ALL prompts to commercial focus
   - Must replace dwelling → building/structure
   - Must add commercial property types
   - Must implement SCOTT's actual expertise

3. **Files Requiring Rework:**
   - `/lib/ai/prompts/scotty-claims-prompt.ts` - Still residential focused
   - `/lib/ai/prompts/qlik-quick-prompts.ts` - Has dwelling/hurricane focus
   - All AI prompts need commercial property context

### Required Actions:

**NOTE: SCOTT prompt has been partially updated to handle BOTH residential and commercial properties**

Current status of `/lib/ai/prompts/scotty-claims-prompt.ts`:
- ✅ Updated to mention SCC's $2B settlements and 300+ years experience
- ✅ Now states expertise in BOTH residential and commercial
- ⚠️ STILL contains residential terminology that needs updating:
  - "Dwelling/Building Limits" should be just "Building/Structure Limits"
  - "Hurricane/Windstorm" focus is too residential
  - Need more commercial-specific sections

1. **Update Property Terminology Throughout:**
   - "Dwelling" → "Building/Structure"
   - "Additional Living Expenses (ALE)" → Keep but ADD "Business Interruption (BI)"
   - "Personal Property" → "Contents/Business Personal Property"

2. **Add Commercial-Specific Sections:**
   - Business Interruption calculations
   - Extra Expense coverage
   - Loss of Rents
   - Supply Chain/Dependent Properties
   - Equipment Breakdown
   - Professional Liability

3. **Maintain Dual Expertise:**
   - Keep residential capabilities
   - Emphasize commercial specialization
   - Show both in examples

4. **Update Quick Actions:**
   - Add commercial-specific quick actions
   - Business interruption calculator
   - Commercial property checklist

# SCC Terminology Mapping Guide

## Purpose
This document provides comprehensive terminology mapping from residential to commercial property insurance context for the SCC rebrand.

## Usage Instructions
1. Search for residential terms in codebase
2. Replace with commercial equivalent
3. Consider context for appropriate variation
4. Test user-facing text for clarity

## Property Terminology

| Residential Term | Commercial Term | Context/Notes |
|-----------------|-----------------|---------------|
| Home/House | Commercial Property | General property reference |
| Residence | Business Property | Legal/formal context |
| Dwelling | Structure/Building | Physical structure |
| Room | Space/Area/Suite | Interior divisions |
| Bedroom | Office | Individual spaces |
| Living Room | Lobby/Common Area | Shared spaces |
| Kitchen | Break Room/Cafeteria | Food prep areas |
| Garage | Loading Dock/Parking | Vehicle areas |

## Insurance Coverage Terms

| Residential Term | Commercial Term | Context/Notes |
|-----------------|-----------------|---------------|
| Homeowners Policy | Commercial Property Policy | Main coverage |
| Personal Property | Business Personal Property | Moveable items |
| Loss of Use | Business Interruption | Income loss |
| Additional Living Expenses | Extra Expense Coverage | Additional costs |
| Liability Coverage | General Liability | Third-party claims |

## Damage Types

| Residential Term | Commercial Term | Context/Notes |
|-----------------|-----------------|---------------|
| Household Items | Business Equipment/Inventory | Contents |
| Personal Belongings | Business Assets | Owned items |
| Appliances | Commercial Equipment | Machinery |
| Furniture | Office Furniture/Fixtures | Furnishings |

|-----------------|-----------------|---------------|
| Home Value | Property Value | Asset worth |
| Mortgage | Commercial Loan | Financing |
| Household Income | Business Revenue | Income |

## Commercial-Specific Terms (No Residential Equivalent)

- **CAT Claims**: Catastrophe claims from major events
- **Large Loss**: Claims exceeding $1 million
- **Business Interruption**: Lost income during closure
- **Ordinance or Law**: Coverage for code upgrades
- **Co-insurance**: Shared insurance requirement
- **Agreed Value**: Pre-determined coverage amount
- **Blanket Coverage**: Single limit for multiple locations
- **Restoration Period**: Time to resume operations

## Industry Acronyms

- **BPP**: Business Personal Property
- **BI**: Business Interruption
- **ACV**: Actual Cash Value
- **RCV**: Replacement Cost Value
- **TIV**: Total Insurable Value
- **PML**: Probable Maximum Loss
- **COPE**: Construction, Occupancy, Protection, Exposure

## Context-Specific Variations

### When discussing damage assessment:
- Use "commercial property inspection" not "home inspection"
- Use "structural assessment" not "house evaluation"
- Use "inventory valuation" not "contents estimate"

### When discussing claim value:
- Emphasize "large loss" for claims over $1M
- Use "business impact" not "family impact"
- Reference "operational disruption" not "lifestyle disruption"

### When discussing timeline:
- Use "business days" for processing times
- Reference "restoration period" not "repair time"
- Mention "revenue recovery" not "getting back to normal"
```

### Search Patterns for Finding Terms

```bash
# Find residential terms
grep -r -i "home\|house\|resident\|dwelling" --include="*.tsx" --include="*.ts"

# Find family references
grep -r -i "family\|household\|personal" --include="*.tsx" --include="*.ts"

# Find living-related terms
grep -r -i "living\|bedroom\|kitchen" --include="*.tsx" --include="*.ts"
```

### Implementation Strategy

1. **Phase 1**: Create mapping document
2. **Phase 2**: Search for all instances
3. **Phase 3**: Systematic replacement
4. **Phase 4**: Context review
5. **Phase 5**: User testing

### Common UI Text Locations

1. **Welcome messages**: Update greeting text
2. **Form labels**: Property type fields
3. **Help text**: Tooltips and descriptions
4. **Error messages**: Context-appropriate errors
5. **Success messages**: Claim completion text
6. **Dashboard widgets**: KPI descriptions
7. **Report templates**: Document headers

### Special Considerations

1. **Legal terminology**: Some terms have legal implications
2. **Industry standards**: Use accepted industry terms
3. **SEO impact**: Consider search keywords
4. **User familiarity**: Balance accuracy with clarity
5. **Regional variations**: Consider geographic differences

### SCC-Specific Terminology

**From SCC Website:**
- "Large-loss commercial claims"
- "CAT (catastrophe) claims"
- "$2 billion in settlements"
- "300+ years collective experience"
- "Commercial property damage"
- "Business interruption claims"
- "Hurricane damage assessment"

### Testing Checklist

- [ ] All form fields use commercial terms
- [ ] Dashboard reflects business context
- [ ] Reports use industry terminology
- [ ] Help text is commercially focused
- [ ] Error messages are appropriate
- [ ] AI responses use commercial context

## PO RE-REVIEW FINDINGS

**Review Date**: 2025-09-25
**Reviewer**: Sarah (Product Owner)
**Result**: **INCOMPLETE** - Mapping created but not applied

### Issues Found:
- ✅ Terminology mapping document was created at `/docs/TERMINOLOGY_MAPPING.md`
- ❌ Mapping was NOT applied to the codebase
- ❌ 15 residential terms still found in 5 files:
  - `/app/claim-assessment/page.tsx` (2 occurrences)
  - `/app/demo/page.tsx` (3 occurrences)
  - `/app/test-sources/page.tsx` (7 occurrences)
  - `/app/inspection/page.tsx` (2 occurrences)
  - `/app/dashboard/claims/[id]/page.tsx` (1 occurrence)

### Required Actions:
1. Apply the terminology mapping to all identified files
2. Replace residential terms with commercial equivalents as documented
3. Ensure no residential terminology remains in user-facing text

## PREVIOUS PO AUDIT FINDINGS

**Initial Audit Date**: 2025-09-25
**Reviewer**: Sarah (Product Owner)
**Result**: **FAILED** - Document created but NOT APPLIED

### Critical Failure:

**The terminology mapping was ONLY DOCUMENTED, not IMPLEMENTED**

1. **Document Created**: ✅ (docs/TERMINOLOGY_MAPPING.md exists)
2. **Mappings Applied**: ❌ **ZERO implementations**

### Evidence of Failure:
- AI prompts still say "dwelling" not "building"
- Still using "hurricane/wind" residential focus
- No commercial property types implemented
- No business terminology in codebase
- Homeowner/residential terms unchanged

### Required Actions:
1. **APPLY the mappings from the document**
2. Update ALL occurrences:
   - Dwelling → Building/Structure
   - Home/House → Commercial Property
   - Homeowner → Property Owner/Business Owner
   - Personal Property → Business Personal Property
   - Loss of Use → Business Interruption
3. Add commercial property types
4. Update all UI text to commercial context
5. Verify NO residential terminology remains

**This story is about IMPLEMENTATION, not documentation!**

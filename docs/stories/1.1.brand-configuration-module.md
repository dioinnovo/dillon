# Story 1.1: Brand Configuration Module

<!-- Powered by BMAD™ Core -->

## Status
**Done**

## Story

**As a** developer implementing the SCC rebrand,
**I want** to create a centralized brand configuration module,
**so that** all brand-related constants and types are defined in one place and can be easily maintained throughout the application.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. TypeScript interface `BrandConfig` is created with proper type definitions for all brand properties
2. Brand constants file exports the `SCC_BRAND` configuration object with all required values
3. Color constants file defines all SCC brand colors as exportable constants
4. All files compile without TypeScript errors
5. Brand configuration can be imported and used in other components
6. Configuration supports both the AI assistant name (SCOTT) and its full persona description

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1: Create TypeScript type definitions** (AC: 1)
  - [x] Create `lib/types/` directory if it doesn't exist
  - [x] Create `lib/types/brand.ts` file
  - [x] Define `BrandConfig` interface with name, logo, colors, and ai properties
  - [x] Export the interface for use in other files

- [x] **Task 2: Create brand constants file** (AC: 2, 5, 6)
  - [x] Create `lib/constants/` directory if it doesn't exist
  - [x] Create `lib/constants/brand.ts` file
  - [x] Import the `BrandConfig` type from `lib/types/brand.ts`
  - [x] Create and export `SCC_BRAND` constant with all values from requirements
  - [x] Include SCC company name: "Strategic Claim Consultants"
  - [x] Include logo path: "/images/scc_logo.png"
  - [x] Include all color values as hex codes
  - [x] Include SCOTT as AI name with full persona description

- [x] **Task 3: Create color constants file** (AC: 3)
  - [x] Create `lib/constants/colors.ts` file
  - [x] Define individual color constants for each SCC brand color
  - [x] Export SCC_COLORS object with all color values
  - [x] Include brand red (#9A2824) for strategic use only (logo, ONE primary CTA)
  - [x] Include full gray scale for UI foundation (#1A1A1A to #F9FAFB)
  - [x] Include semantic colors: success (#00A651), warning (#F59E0B), error (#DC2626), info (#3B82F6)

- [x] **Task 4: Verify TypeScript compilation** (AC: 4)
  - [x] Run TypeScript compiler to check for errors
  - [x] Fix any type errors that arise
  - [x] Ensure all imports/exports are properly configured

- [x] **Task 5: Create test import file** (AC: 5)
  - [x] Create a temporary test file to verify imports work
  - [x] Import brand configuration from all created files
  - [x] Verify intellisense and type checking work correctly
  - [x] Delete test file after verification

## Dev Notes

### Source Files from Architecture (SCC-rebrand-architecture.md)

**Brand Configuration Structure:**
```typescript
// From architecture document, section "Component Architecture"
export interface BrandConfig {
  name: string
  logo: string
  colors: {
    primary: string
    secondary: string
    success: string
  }
  ai: {
    name: string
    persona: string
  }
}
```

**Strategic Color System:**

**Brand Colors (Use Sparingly):**
- Primary Brand: #9A2824 (SCC Deep Red - logos, key CTAs only)
- Primary Hover: #7A1F1C (Darker Red for hover states)

**UI Foundation Colors (Primary Usage):**
- Primary UI: #2B2B2B (Dark Gray - main buttons, headers)
- Secondary: #707070 (Professional Gray - secondary actions)
- Text Primary: #2B2B2B (Dark Gray Text)
- Text Secondary: #707070 (Gray Text)
- Background: #F5F5F5 (Light Gray Background)
- Surface: #FFFFFF (White for cards)
- Border: #E0E0E0 (Light Gray borders)

**Semantic Colors:**
- Success: #00A651 (Green for positive metrics)
- Warning: #F59E0B (Amber for warnings)
- Error: #DC2626 (True Red for errors only)
- Info: #3B82F6 (Blue for information)

**Usage Guidelines:**
- SCC Red (#9A2824): Logo, primary CTA (one per page), brand accents
- Dark Gray (#2B2B2B): Most buttons, navigation, headers
- Gray (#707070): Secondary buttons, less important text
- Success Green: Positive metrics, success states
- Error Red: Error messages only (not brand red)

**AI Assistant Details:**
- Name: SCOTT
- Full Form: Strategic Claims Operations & Technical Tracker
- Role: Property claims expert for Strategic Claim Consultants
- Expertise: Both residential and commercial properties, with specialized expertise in large-loss commercial claims ($1M+), CAT claims, and business interruption
- Track Record: Leverages SCC's $2 billion in recovered settlements

**File Organization from Architecture:**

├── constants/
│   ├── brand.ts              [NEW: Brand configuration]
│   ├── colors.ts             [NEW: Color constants]

├── types/
│   ├── brand.ts              [NEW: Brand type definitions]
│   └── ...
```

### Important Implementation Notes

1. **Directory Structure**: The `/lib` directory should already exist in the Next.js project. Create subdirectories `constants` and `types` if they don't exist.

2. **Import Paths**: Use absolute imports with `@/lib/` prefix if the project is configured for it, otherwise use relative imports.

3. **Export Pattern**: Use named exports for better tree-shaking and explicit imports.

4. **Type Safety**: Ensure all color values are validated as hex codes and the logo path exists in public directory.

### Previous Story Context
This is the first story in the SCC rebrand epic, so no previous story context exists.

### Testing Standards

**From Architecture Document - Testing Strategy Section:**
- All new TypeScript files must compile without errors
- Exports must be testable via simple import statements
- Type definitions should provide proper IntelliSense support
- Consider adding unit tests for color value validation if time permits

**Testing Location:**
- If creating tests, place them in `__tests__/lib/constants/` directory
- Use Jest for testing if it's configured in the project
